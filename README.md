# Gobblet-Gobblers
My first ever project at faculty, for Introduction in Programing.I worked on this project with two other friends, it being our first project, it's not as well-made or optimized. We used the graphics.h graphics library and tried to do our best with the knowledge we had at the time.
The purpose of this cute little game is to create a line of three of your pieces (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally), but you can also stack them, even on top of your opponent's! However, be careful to remember which piece is underneath, so you don't accidentally ruin your strategy!
